# RayCast
A GUI for rendering a 3D raycasting perspective that corresponds to a 2D map.

## How It Works
The program is a Windows Forms App (.NET Framework). When running *Program.cs*, the user can interact with a GUI that shows two panels: a two-dimensional map that gives an overview and a pseudo-three-dimensional render of the corresponding perspective. 
The map consists of a space filled with boundaries (walls) and a moveable source (which represents the point of view).

The following interactive components are available:
* Change position and direction using the WASD-keys.
* Change viewing direction using the mouse-wheel (only when mouse hovers over the 3D panel).
* Adjust the field of vision by changing the angle using the first trackbar.
* Adjust the height of the boundaries using the second trackbar.
* Adjust the viewing distance using the third trackbar.
* RESET: reset all trackbars to default values.
* ADD WALLS: insert boundaries in the 2D map by mouse-dragging.
* REMOVE WALLS: delete boundaries in the 2D map by mouse-clicking on them.
* CLEAR: remove all boundaries except the outermost walls.
* RANDOM: replace all current boundaries by five randomly placed walls.
